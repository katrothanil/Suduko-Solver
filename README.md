# Suduko-Solver
Sudoku solver is a mini project on data structures
and algorithms .The core of Sudoku solvers is a back‐
tracking algorithm, such as the recursive depth‐first
search algorithm.The algorithm tries to place numbers
in empty cells while ensuring that the Sudoku rules are
not violated. If it encounters a dead‐end or invalid con‐
figuration, it backtracks and tries a different value until
a solution is found.
